<h1 id="responding-to-the-challenges">Responding to the Challenges</h1>
<p>We can describe the basic challenge we face like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>we seek to <strong>understand the world</strong> (including
ourselves) better</li>
<li>so that we can work to <strong>make the world a better
place</strong> (and to make us better people)</li>
<li>while we <strong>avoid the dangers</strong> posed by our proposed
changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can improve our understanding through talking with one another -
by talking about our ideas so they can be shared and improved, and by
telling our stories so the ideas can be grounded in the real world. When
talking about possible solutions, there are two big dangers: on the one
hand we can be too idealistic; on the other, we can be too
pragmatic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity</strong>. At the one extreme, people believe in a
united world, with everybody in perfect harmony. In this vision,
everyone works together, all for a single purpose, and disagreement is
not allowed; the world is a carefully regulated society, in which each
person plays the part which the whole society requires of them.</li>
<li><strong>Division</strong>. At the other extreme, people believe in a
divided world, with everybody in conflict. In this vision, we work
together for temporary, selfish reasons, because we must; the world is a
jungle, ‘red in tooth and claw’; in the end it is ‘every man for
himself’.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>. Our vision is of a middle way: one where
difference does not lead to disagreement, nor variety lead to conflict.
We believe we can learn from and live with one another, without needing
to agree with one another on every point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same basic choices face us when we attempt to describe what we
are aiming for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idealistic</strong>. At the one extreme, people attempt to
describe a perfect society.</li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic</strong>. At the other extreme, people settle for
simply fixing the worst consequences of our current system.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>. Our vision is of a middle way: to address
not only the injustices and failings produced by the present system, but
also the structural problems which create those injustices and failings,
as we seek to move towards a society which is better for everyone, and
better for the planet.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="systems-and-society">Systems and Society</h1>
<p>The problems we face are primarily seen in the systems we operate,
rather than the people who operate them.</p>
<p>Yes, some people are bad - cruel, selfish and insensitive. But most
of the problems which most of us face are not caused by bad people
seeking to do bad things: they are caused by people who are mostly good,
doing their best within systems which don’t work, either for most people
or for the environment.</p>
<p>It is really hard to change these systems. We struggle even to
understand them: they are formed from laws and customs and culture, from
our expectations and the physical environment we inherit and create,
from habits and assumptions, from promises and commitments, from fear of
the unknown and fear of strangers, from ignorance and confusion, and
much else.</p>
<p>There is no agreement about what a perfect society might look like -
we certainly don’t want to live in the ‘perfect’ societies of Plato’s
Republic or Moore’s Utopia. On the other hand, there are clear
structural problems within our society which harm people and damage the
world, so as well as patching up the current problems, we can seek to
make the structural problems less of a problem. And maybe, if we can
move in the direction of a more just and more sustainable society, we
might find new people are able to contribute, and new possibilities can
be found to address problems which seem beyond us at present.</p>
<p>And one thing seems clear: we will not succeed in solving our
problems unless we learn to work together, with all our differences.
Everybody is needed; so please contribute your ideas and perspectives.
And those contributions need to include constructive criticism: we need
to understand the downsides and disadvantages of the solutions being
proposed, so those weaknesses can be taken into account and perhaps
countered.</p>
