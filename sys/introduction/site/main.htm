<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>We aim to create a community, but once it grows, the reality is that
it will be multiple interconnected communities, joined together by the
individuals who are interested in multiple areas, but also joined by a
common commitment to the truth and to making the world a better
place.</p>
<p>We need to share our passion, information, analysis and proposed
solutions because it is far too easy to propose answers which work for
some people but work against others. (The recent football ‘super league’
is a classic case in point: it would have worked very well for the few
participating clubs, but very badly for all the others.) If we only talk
with others who have a vested interest in making our plan work, we never
get to hear the objections.</p>
<p>To assist in building communities of interested people, anyone can
set up a group to facilitate communication about a specific subject. But
there will not be groups to advocate for a specific solution, even if
that solution is, in practice, your starting point: the solutions need
to take into account all the relevant factors, and we need to be open to
change the solution if others can offer (and demonstrate they offer) a
better alternative.</p>
<p>We want to deliver a combination of blogs, articles and discussion
groups, connecting between the various strands where helpful.</p>
<h1 id="details">Details</h1>
<h2 id="blogs-and-articles">Blogs and Articles</h2>
<p>In the blogs, you are free to post your personal views - and others
are free to comment on them - about whatever you wish to talk about. We
hope that this will help in getting to know one another, and maybe in
raising subjects which need to be explored in the rest of the site.</p>
<p>In the articles, we seek eventually to cover all the important topics
and issues which we struggle with in seeking to make the world a better
place. We are aiming to have one article on each subject, and to link it
in to the related articles.</p>
<p>The articles should be regarded as provisional: the best
understanding we have right now, but always subject to revision,
correction and clarification as more people post their comments and
feedback.</p>
<h2 id="personal-and-communal">Personal and Communal</h2>
<p>As far as possible, articles should reflect our corporate
understanding of the subject - if you don’t want to do that, please
create a blog post instead. If you write an article, you retain control
of the content, but you are expected to update it, as appropriate, in
the light of feedback.</p>
<p>There is a careful balance to be held here between allowing people to
express their views and expecting them to take on board the views of
others: we believe this balance can be found if we are all committed
both to seeking the truth and to compassion for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="concise-and-comprehensive">Concise and Comprehensive</h2>
<p>We aim for all articles to be as brief as possible, with related
details going into related (and linked) articles. This approach should
focus the discussion, make it easier for people to engage, and easier
for the community to seek a common understanding while exploring their
varied perspectives.</p>
<p>Where a common understanding is not possible, each alternative should
be presented and summarized as fairly as possible; each alternative will
probably need to be explored in a linked article of their own. However,
if the author of an article does not want to include your perspective
within their article, please write an alternative version from your
perspective, and we will link to both versions so that others can
compare them.</p>
<p>For an important and difficult subject, the main article should
function as an introduction - again, as comprehensive and unbiased as
possible, pointing to the more detailed and more difficult articles.</p>
<p>If you are unable to maintain an article you created, and are unable
to find a suitable person to take it on, please say so on the page, to
help the site administrators pick up on the gap.</p>
