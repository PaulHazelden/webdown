***Just Human?***

*Just Human?* is a community centred around this website.  Like most 
people, we want to make the world a better place, and this will only 
happen if we - and many other people - work to make this happen.

But we recognize that there are many different (and sometimes 
contradictory) ideas about what needs to happen.  There is no point 
in talking about these things with people who agree with us: the 
only way we can make real progress is if we talk about the 
questions which matter to us with people who don't already agree - 
and who may strongly disagree.

We don't enjoy disagreement; we want to come to a place where 
everybody agrees on the important things we need to do.  But the 
only way to get there is to disagree well: to seek to understand 
one another, and discover what we can learn from each other.

The pages in this Introduction section of the site should tell you 
everything you need to know about us, about what we are seeking to 
do, and what we would expect of you if you decide to join us.  If, 
after reading these pages, you would like to join us - then welcome, 
and thank you!  Please follow the link at the top right hand corner 
of the page.  You will be added to the email list, but you can 
always unsubscribe whenever you choose - and you will remain a 
member of the community unless you also choose to leave.

**About Us**

-    Vision: this covers our vision, purpose and strategy.
-    Values: this describes our priorities - what we seek to do,
     the things we have to remember as we do it, and what we need
     to be careful about.

**Key Details**

-    Site: what you will find here, and how to use the various
     parts of the site.
-    Money: how we manage the money to operate this community,
     and why we do it this way - including why there is a small
     membership fee.

**About You**

-    Behaviour: the behaviour we expect from everyone who
     contributes to this site.
-    Limits: we don't want to tell you what you can't do, but
     there are a few obvious things which do need to be said.

**Finally ...**

This is all provisional.  If you think we have missed or mistaken 
anything, please let us know - especially if you can offer what 
you consider to be a better alternative.  Thank you!
