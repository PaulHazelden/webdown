<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>We want to make the world a better place: by talking with, listening to - and potentially working with - people who see the world differently.</p>
<p>We - the people on this site (and, we trust, you) - want to make the world a better place. The question is: how?  An important part of the answer is: with help from one another - we can't do this on our own.  If we want to make this happen, we will need to learn how to cooperate, really cooperate, with one another.</p>
<p>Right now, the challenges the world faces, but also the possibilities for real change, are greater than they have been in our lifetime.  So we want to do everything we can to understand the challenges and come up with the best possible responses, to enable us to work together and make the best changes happen.</p>
<p>What the human race does today, and in the next few years - how we live, the choices we make - will shape the world, and decide our future.</p>
