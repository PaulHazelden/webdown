There is probably a lot which needs to be said about ideas, beliefs and values, how we arrive at them, and how we handle them. We need to explore these topics: few people doubt that the core things we understand, believe and value make a massive difference both to our individual wellbeing, and to the activities we undertake.

At the moment, we only have contributions from the Christian, from the Humanist, and from a general 'thinking about thinking and beliefs' perspectives; if you would like to contribute from other religions and other perspectives, you are very welcome.

When talking about a religion or belief system, please be particularly careful to ensure that any comments are fair and helpful.
