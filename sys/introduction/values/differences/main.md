**We recognize that everybody is different**, even though we share many things in common; we can learn from one another, but cannot demand that what works for me will also work for you.  We seek to find, not ‘the’ answer to difficult questions, but a range of answers, each of which will work for a different group of people, so that while you will probably not find every answer helpful, you may at least find something helpful.

As we say in the Vision: everything matters, but not everything matters the same amount; when we have the choice, we generally seek to concentrate on the important stuff.   (But not always: it's okay to take time off, relax and play sometimes.)

**Everything matters**: if something matters to someone, then it matters to us.  Please don't tell people they should not care about something, when they say that they do care.

**Different things matter by different amounts**: just because we say that several things all matter, this does not mean that they all matter the same amount.  We are allowed to have priorities; these prorities can change with time - and your priorities do not have to agree with mine.

**Time matters differently for different people**: past, present and future are all important, but they don't all matter to the same extent.  Some of us naturally focus mainly on one, and some on another, but all three are important, to some extent, to all of us.
