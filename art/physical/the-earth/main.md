These seem to be the major Issues.

-    Climate Change
-    Pollution: both chemicals and plastics - we can find toxic metals in 
     the Himalayan peaks, and plastic fibres in the deepest reaches of 
     the ocean; air pollution is killing more people than the Covid 19 
     pandemic did.
-    Water: there are several distinct problems, especially relating to 
     the increasing demand and decreasing supply of fresh water.
