<p>Building a Markdown and GitHub driven textfile based website
generator</p>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Build a community website engine using Markdown, based on text files
stored and version controlled in GitHub.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to create a way to build and maintain a
community website which is simple and transparent, built in a modular
fashion with well-defined interfaces between the various parts.</p>
<p>Two basic programs are needed: one to create and maintain the various
parts of the site, and the other to generate the pages. Two subsidiary
programs can be identified at this stage: an internal consistency
checker, which we will need to run as a stand-alone tool sometimes; and
probably a bank account query tool to check whether a membership payment
has been received from a specified User.</p>
<p>The original plan was to use GitHub to generate the file version meta
data and host the web site. However, GitHub (unlike a version control
tool I used in the past) does not enable version details to be included
within the files, and GitHub does not enable PHP to be executed in its
pages, so it cannot host the web site. So GitHub is looking less ideal
as a tool here. But we started down this route, so let’s continue in
this direction for now. And it is a good way to share progress.</p>
<p>The page generatiion is relatively straightforward, so let’s
concentrate on that initially. Once the pages can be generated from the
source files, then we will have proved the concept, and can focus on the
more challenging task of generating and maintaining the source
files.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The project arose out of thinking about the requirements for a
community website for ‘<a href="https://just-human.net/"
title="&#39;Just Human?&#39; website">Just Human?</a>’, and builds on
ideas which were successfully used years ago to build an application
generator for a software house.</p>
