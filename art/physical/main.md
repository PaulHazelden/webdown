# The Issues

Let's be clear about the nature of the physical challenges we face.

  *  [The Earth](../../ref/page.php?p=19):
     *    Global Climate Change
     *    Pollution - both chemicals and plastics
     *    Fresh water - increasing demand and decreasing supply
  *  The Biosphere:
     *    Loss of biodiversity
     *    Mass extinction - both species and genera
     *    Species migration - including human migration
     *    Antibiotic resistance
     *    Loss of topsoil
  *  The Human Race
     *    Overpopulation - and the consequences of ageing populations
     *    Unrestricted economic growth
     *    Pandemics, currently the Covid-19 Pandemic 

There is a short (under 20 minutes) video by Economics Explained which summarizes many of these issues: MIT Has Predicted that Society Will Collapse in 2040.

# The Solutions

These proposals to address the physical world problems are (to a first approximation anyway) all necessary. We can't just pick one and think we have 'done our bit' - we have to do all of them, or the world as we know it does not survive.

*    Energy
*    Farming (and growing things, generally)
*    Water
*    Finance
*    Manufacturing
     *    What is manufactured
     *    Where it is manufactured
*    Plastics
*    Poisonous chemicals
*    Transport
