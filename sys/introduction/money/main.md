# Principles

These are the basic principles concerning how we handle money.

-    **We will ask the members for a monthly membership fee**; we 
    will ask (but not require) wealthier members to 
    contribute a higher amount, and we will provide a bursary 
    place for anyone who is genuinely unable to afford it.
-    **We will pay our way**.  While we expect our members to 
    contribute through their membership fees, we will not 
    expect people or organizations to donate goods or services.  
    We will, however, gratefully receive any finance, goods 
    or services which are freely offered.
-    **We will pay a fair rate for work we ask people to do**.  Most 
    of the input from people will be voluntary, but where people 
    are asked to provide a service (such as graphic design or 
    website building), that service will be paid for at a normal 
    commercial rate unless the person or organization concerned 
    offers their time and skills for free or a reduced rate.
-    **We will raise funds before we spend them**.  We will not
     take out loans, take on financial obligations without having
     the necessary resources, or get into debt by any other means.
-    **We will operate an open book policy**.  All transactions
     will go through the accounts and the details of most
     transactions will be made public.
-    **We will operate a bank account**.  Payments will require
     two signatures.
-    **We will not store cash**.  All financial transactions
     will go through the bank account; any cash donations (should
     there be any) will be paid into the bank account at the
     earliest possible opportunity.

# Reasons

The membership fee is currently £5 a month, but we are open to 
reviewing it.  If you cannot afford £5, we ask you to contribute 
£1 a month.  If you genuinely cannot afford £1 but wish to join, 
we have some bursary places available so please contact us for 
details.  There are several basic reasons for this membership 
fee: for more about these reasons, please see Why a Membership 
Fee? but, in summary, they are ...

-    **Knowing the members**.  We are building a community where 
    you can know and trust the other members, and this means we 
    have to know who the members are.  A monthly payment connects 
    your membership identity with someone in the real world, and 
    discourages trolls from joining in order to disrupt the discussions.
-    **Covering the costs**.  It costs money to operate a community 
    like this, and the costs grow as the community grows.  While 
    the costs are initially low, we do not want to be in a position 
    where the community is successful and then we have to ask people 
    to start contributing to something they have become used to 
    receiving for free.
-    **Unbiased choices**.  The finance has to come from somewhere 
    and, as we know,  'the person who pays the piper calls the tune'.  
    There are only a few ways of covering the costs, and they all 
    have disadvantages.
-    **Future possibilities**.  If this community is successful, and 
    we develop a vision for how we can make the world a better place, 
    then the presence of some money in the bank will give us the 
    possibility of deciding to do something worthwhile together.

# Advantages
This approach provides several advantages, and enables us to make some commitments.

-    The financial aspect of the project is explicit and addressed up front.
-    There is only one category of membership: nobody can pay for 
    greater access or privilege than anyone else.
-    The project will not be financially supported through advertising, 
    with all the implications of support and endorsement of specific 
    products and services.
-    The membership details will not be sold or otherwise made available 
    to any external body.
