<p>We will list here the members who have created a blog. And also,
perhaps, the dates of the first and last blog posts they have made.</p>
<p>Ideally, we will be able to sort this list by any column - name,
first date, or last date.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Name</th>
<th>First Post</th>
<th>Last Post</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Alfred Purple</td>
<td>7 Dec 2019</td>
<td>8 Mar 2022</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Barry Indigo</td>
<td>27 Feb 2016</td>
<td>27 Feb 2016</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Coleen Blue</td>
<td>18 Sep 2017</td>
<td>9 May 2023</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
