<p>There is probably a lot which needs to be said about ideas, beliefs
and values, how we arrive at them, and how we handle them. We need to
explore these topics: few people doubt that the core things we
understand, believe and value make a massive difference both to our
individual wellbeing, and to the activities we undertake.</p>
<p>At the moment, we only have contributions from the Christian, from
the Humanist, and from a general ‘thinking about thinking and beliefs’
perspectives; if you would like to contribute from other religions and
other perspectives, you are very welcome.</p>
<p>When talking about a religion or belief system, please be
particularly careful to ensure that any comments are fair and
helpful.</p>
