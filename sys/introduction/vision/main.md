# Summary

**We want to make the world a better place: by talking with, listening to - and potentially working with - people who see the world differently.**

# Vision

Our **vision** is to **make the world a better place.**

We want to make the world a better place.  This is not the same as, although it may include, solving problems and changing things which are currently wrong: it is often fairly easy to fix one problem by creating another problem, or to address one injustice by creating another.  Making the world a better place is more difficult than just fixing a few specific wrongs.

We may want to make the world a better place, but this will only happen if we are sufficiently motivated, and if we work together.  The challenges we face are serious: they deserve to be met with our best efforts; so we seek to work together, and to work with all the passion and energy we can manage, so our actions must be an authentic expression of our most important beliefs and values.

We cannot tell you what to do - and we would not want to, anyway.  But we can share with each other the best ways we have found to make the world a better place, both locally and globally.  We can't solve the world's problems but, equally well, we can't just sit back and hope someone else does it for us: we choose to play the part we are each capable of.  We seek to be constantly learning, so that we may become well informed, about both the challenges we face and the best ways of responding to them.
