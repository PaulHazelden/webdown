<h1 id="the-issues">The Issues</h1>
<p>Let’s be clear about the nature of the physical challenges we
face.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Earth:
<ul>
<li>Global Climate Change</li>
<li>Pollution - both chemicals and plastics</li>
<li>Fresh water - increasing demand and decreasing supply</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Biosphere:
<ul>
<li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
<li>Mass extinction - both species and genera</li>
<li>Species migration - including human migration</li>
<li>Antibiotic resistance</li>
<li>Loss of topsoil</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Human Race
<ul>
<li>Overpopulation - and the consequences of ageing populations</li>
<li>Unrestricted economic growth</li>
<li>Pandemics, currently the Covid-19 Pandemic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a short (under 20 minutes) video by Economics Explained
which summarizes many of these issues: MIT Has Predicted that Society
Will Collapse in 2040.</p>
<h1 id="the-solutions">The Solutions</h1>
<p>These proposals to address the physical world problems are (to a
first approximation anyway) all necessary. We can’t just pick one and
think we have ‘done our bit’ - we have to do all of them, or the world
as we know it does not survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Farming (and growing things, generally)</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Manufacturing
<ul>
<li>What is manufactured</li>
<li>Where it is manufactured</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Plastics</li>
<li>Poisonous chemicals</li>
<li>Transport</li>
</ul>
