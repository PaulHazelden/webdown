## Introduction

A person had a problem, and asked a Project Manager to help.

Following a wise methodology, the Project Manager:

*    clarified the nature of the problem, and what a solution would look like;
*    defined the solution architecture, identifying the main parts and the relationship between them;
*    built only as much as was needed at each step;
*    created each unit and its test suite together;
*    used the experience of building to test, clarify and discover assumptions;
*    when assumptions changed, revisited and revised the unit, the architecture, the solution and the problem statement as required; and
*    continued building and testing and checking until the project was complete and the problem was solved.

## The Thought

In the world of IT, we are talking about Agile software development.  But this approach to managing software development can usefully be applied to the rest of life, too.
