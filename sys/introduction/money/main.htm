<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>These are the basic principles concerning how we handle money.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We will ask the members for a monthly membership
fee</strong>; we will ask (but not require) wealthier members to
contribute a higher amount, and we will provide a bursary place for
anyone who is genuinely unable to afford it.</li>
<li><strong>We will pay our way</strong>. While we expect our members to
contribute through their membership fees, we will not expect people or
organizations to donate goods or services.<br />
We will, however, gratefully receive any finance, goods or services
which are freely offered.</li>
<li><strong>We will pay a fair rate for work we ask people to
do</strong>. Most of the input from people will be voluntary, but where
people are asked to provide a service (such as graphic design or website
building), that service will be paid for at a normal commercial rate
unless the person or organization concerned offers their time and skills
for free or a reduced rate.</li>
<li><strong>We will raise funds before we spend them</strong>. We will
not take out loans, take on financial obligations without having the
necessary resources, or get into debt by any other means.</li>
<li><strong>We will operate an open book policy</strong>. All
transactions will go through the accounts and the details of most
transactions will be made public.</li>
<li><strong>We will operate a bank account</strong>. Payments will
require two signatures.</li>
<li><strong>We will not store cash</strong>. All financial transactions
will go through the bank account; any cash donations (should there be
any) will be paid into the bank account at the earliest possible
opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reasons">Reasons</h1>
<p>The membership fee is currently £5 a month, but we are open to
reviewing it. If you cannot afford £5, we ask you to contribute £1 a
month. If you genuinely cannot afford £1 but wish to join, we have some
bursary places available so please contact us for details. There are
several basic reasons for this membership fee: for more about these
reasons, please see <a href="../../../ref/page.htm?p=20">Why a
Membership Fee?</a> but, in summary, they are …</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing the members</strong>. We are building a community
where you can know and trust the other members, and this means we have
to know who the members are. A monthly payment connects your membership
identity with someone in the real world, and discourages trolls from
joining in order to disrupt the discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Covering the costs</strong>. It costs money to operate a
community like this, and the costs grow as the community grows. While
the costs are initially low, we do not want to be in a position where
the community is successful and then we have to ask people to start
contributing to something they have become used to receiving for
free.</li>
<li><strong>Unbiased choices</strong>. The finance has to come from
somewhere and, as we know, ‘the person who pays the piper calls the
tune’. There are only a few ways of covering the costs, and they all
have disadvantages.</li>
<li><strong>Future possibilities</strong>. If this community is
successful, and we develop a vision for how we can make the world a
better place, then the presence of some money in the bank will give us
the possibility of deciding to do something worthwhile together.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="advantages">Advantages</h1>
<p>This approach provides several advantages, and enables us to make
some commitments.</p>
<ul>
<li>The financial aspect of the project is explicit and addressed up
front.</li>
<li>There is only one category of membership: nobody can pay for greater
access or privilege than anyone else.</li>
<li>The project will not be financially supported through advertising,
with all the implications of support and endorsement of specific
products and services.</li>
<li>The membership details will not be sold or otherwise made available
to any external body.</li>
