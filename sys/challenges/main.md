This is the workshop area, where we seek to describe a better world, and work out how to build it.

We have divided the challenges into three basic areas: partly because different people have 
different areas of interest, partly because the different areas require different tools and 
strategies, and partly to help us keep a broad perspective on the challenges we face, while 
maintaining a narrow focus on each specific area we need to consider.

-    The [Framework](../../ref/page.htm?p=14) describes this division and provides some background.
-    [Responding to the Challenges](../../ref/page.htm?p=15) describes in outline how we seek to address the many different problems we face.  To state the obvious: for a complete response to the challenges we face, we need to integrate all three areas.  If we are going to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to change the way we live, which requires us to cooperate - probably in ways and at a scale never before seen in history - on achieving goals we can agree are both right and important.

The three areas are: 

-    [Physical](../../ref/page.htm?p=16).  Roughly, the subject matter of the 'hard sciences'; answering questions about energy and atoms, particles and forces; asking questions like, "What is happening?" and "Do we have the physical resources?"
-    [Social](../../ref/page.htm?p=17).  Roughly, the subject matter of the humanities or 'social sciences'; answering questions about people and societies; asking questions like, "Why is this happening?" and "How can we legislate for sustainable living?"
-    [Spiritual](../../ref/page.htm?p=18).  Roughly, the subject matter of the philosophers and religions; answering questions about morality, values and purpose; asking questions like, "What should be happening?" and "What motivates people to live better lives?"

In addition:

-    The Articles page provides a different way to access the content which can be found under the three areas above.
-    The Forum provides a place for people to discuss issues, apart from writing and responding to articles.
