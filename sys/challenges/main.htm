<p>This is the workshop area, where we seek to describe a better world,
and work out how to build it.</p>
<p>We have divided the challenges into three basic areas: partly because
different people have different areas of interest, partly because the
different areas require different tools and strategies, and partly to
help us keep a broad perspective on the challenges we face, while
maintaining a narrow focus on each specific area we need to
consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../ref/page.htm?p=14">Framework</a> describes this
division and provides some background.</li>
<li><a href="../../ref/page.htm?p=15">Responding to the Challenges</a>
describes in outline how we seek to address the many different problems
we face. To state the obvious: for a complete response to the challenges
we face, we need to integrate all three areas. If we are going to
prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to change the
way we live, which requires us to cooperate - probably in ways and at a
scale never before seen in history - on achieving goals we can agree are
both right and important.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../ref/page.htm?p=16">Physical</a>. Roughly, the subject
matter of the ‘hard sciences’; answering questions about energy and
atoms, particles and forces; asking questions like, “What is happening?”
and “Do we have the physical resources?”</li>
<li><a href="../../ref/page.htm?p=17">Social</a>. Roughly, the subject
matter of the humanities or ‘social sciences’; answering questions about
people and societies; asking questions like, “Why is this happening?”
and “How can we legislate for sustainable living?”</li>
<li><a href="../../ref/page.htm?p=18">Spiritual</a>. Roughly, the
subject matter of the philosophers and religions; answering questions
about morality, values and purpose; asking questions like, “What should
be happening?” and “What motivates people to live better lives?”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Articles page provides a different way to access the content
which can be found under the three areas above.</li>
<li>The Forum provides a place for people to discuss issues, apart from
writing and responding to articles.</li>
</ul>
