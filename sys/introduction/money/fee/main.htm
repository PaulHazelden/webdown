<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Many - probably most - online communities operate without a
membership fee, so why are we asking our members to pay for the
privilege of participating?</p>
<p>There are several reasons: we need to cover our costs in a way which
allows for future growth, we need to be confident we know who the
members are, and we choose to handle the questions of power and control
in a transparent manner. None of this is set in stone, and (as always)
we welcome feedback, comments and alternative ideas, but this is where
we are at present.</p>
<h1 id="covering-the-costs">Covering the Costs</h1>
<p>There are several areas of cost involved in a community and web site
like this. Remember that one of our principles is that we pay our way:
if people offer to do work on a voluntary basis, we are grateful, but if
we ask people to do work for us, we expect to pay them a fair rate for
the job.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of running. Monthly or annual fees for the domain, website
hosting, the community software platform and the email server.</li>
<li>The cost of development. The initial setup was undertaken without
professional support; the plan is, when we can afford it, to pay for
some design work, and maybe for some software development - we would
like to provide some features which do not appear to be commercially
available anywhere, yet.</li>
<li>The cost of maintenance. As more people join and more content is
contributed, it will be important for content to be revised and
restructured, and for people to be responded to in a timely fashion; at
some point, this will move beyond the ability of volunteers to manage
and will need some dedicated time devoted to the work, which should be
paid for.</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs will grow if the community grows, and we want the
community to grow. Many successful ‘hobby’ projects have failed in the
end because they became too successful, the creator could not afford to
continue to pay for the resources the larger group needed, and you never
get enough people responding to requests for voluntary contributions
when they had joined a free service.</p>
<p>When there are only a few dozen members, depending on the setup, the
few costs may be small and insignificant, and easily covered on a
voluntary basis by the few members. But when there are a few hundred
members, or a few thousand, the ‘free’ and ‘personal’ product tiers are
no longer available, and the monthly costs quickly add up. The
transition from a free service relying on voluntary donations to a
service operating a different model is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>We are (as of March 2022) a long way off being able to pay for the
work which we want to do. We are currently operating with a cut-down
version of Ning, and don’t yet have enough income to afford the full
version. Perhaps, in the future, the requested £5 can be reduced, but at
present we need to raise more funds in order to achieve our vision.</p>
<h1 id="knowing-the-members">Knowing the Members</h1>
<p>One of the core foundations of this community is that we know who we
are interacting with. Of course, nothing in this life is certain, and it
is possible for someone to join and mislead us about who they are, but a
membership fee connects the member to a bank account in the real world,
and this makes it much less likely that people will attempt to
misrepresent who they are.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the membership fees should be optional. In
a sense, they are: if someone cannot afford the fees (a minimum of £1 a
month), then there is a bursary scheme, which they can apply to. But if
we allow people to join without paying, then malicious and disruptive
individuals can join and cause problems; when they are banned, they can
simply create a new email address and join again. A single-issue or
disruptive group could flood the site and drown out those who don’t
agree with them.</p>
<p>Of course, many groups operate without this problem, and if you
operate a group for (say) model railway enthusiasts, perhaps this
problem does not affect you. But we are seeking to enable people to talk
about important issues which matter deeply to us; many of us have found
it impossible to discuss them on public sites (such as Facebook) which
allow people, who are effectively anonymous, to join discussions, take
them off at a tangent, and insult anyone who sees things
differently.</p>
<p>This community only works because we can be confident that we know
who people are, and that only works because the membership fee connects
the members with their real life identity. There are a few valid
situations where a member may not want to world to know who they are,
and this occasional situation can be handled in much the same way as the
bursary scheme - but, for everyone else, your real-world identity is
important.</p>
<h1 id="avoiding-moral-compromise">Avoiding Moral Compromise</h1>
<p>As we all know, ‘the person who pays the piper calls the tune’ -
money is not just a practical issue: the way money is handled is deeply
connected with questions of power and control. The way in which money is
obtained and spent has a direct influence on the moral integrity of the
group, and on how it seeks to achieve its aims. We believe that
transparency in this area is vital - which is why we explicitly describe
the way we will handle money.</p>
<p>If there are costs which have to be covered, there are only a few
basic options for how to do it. The costs can be covered by:</p>
<ul>
<li>voluntary donations;</li>
<li>one person, or a few committed individuals;</li>
<li>corporate sponsorship;</li>
<li>sales;</li>
<li>advertising; or</li>
<li>membership fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not exclusive, of course. The problems are obvious: people
rarely make voluntary donations to support online activities, and it is
hard to plan for the future when you do not know what the income may be.
If the main costs are covered by a few people or groups, then it is hard
to avoid the funders having a significant influence over the activities
and direction of the group. Similarly, if the income is derived from
advertising then there is a real pressure to increase the page views,
and we all know (presumably?) where that strategy ends up. And we don’t
have anything to sell.</p>
<p>The members can only direct the group, and be confident that they are
genuinely directing the group, if the income comes primarily from
membership fees. All the other options mean that somebody else is
calling the shots.</p>
<h1 id="following-the-vision">Following the Vision</h1>
<p>One further thought: we have a vision for how to help build a better
world, and how to facilitate the kind of human interactions which this
will require. We have described this vision very briefly, but it does
need to be filled out in more detail. We will need money to make the
necessary changes to this site (to enhance it, or maybe move to another
platform, or even build a new platform which does what we believe is
needed) - and, perhaps, help us participate in changing the world in
other ways. The details of what we do will be up to the membership, and
the Steering Group, but none of it will be possible without some money,
and without some reasonable expectation of future income. Which takes us
back to the various ways in which income can be raised, and the benefits
and drawbacks of each.</p>
